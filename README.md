# ensf400-lab6-terraform

## Objectives
This lab will give us an overview of Infrastructure-as-Code (IaC) with examples using Terraform.
Terraform works primarily with public cloud services which would incur charges for the creation of
cloud-based resources. To avoid the costs of practicing Terraform tasks and to be able to 
work on the lab tasks freely, we will use [LocalStack](https://docs.localstack.cloud/overview/) to
create a simulated environment of AWS services.
